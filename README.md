This is a readme file for the entire solution.


## Deployment

When you download the repo there is a BlazorCrud.sln that you open prefferebly with Visual Studio 2022.
There are 3 startup projects, you need all three of them in order to test the whole application.



## Run Locally

When you run the project 3 tabs will open.
5443 is the port where the IdentityServer is hosted.
5444 hosts the client and
5445 hosts the server(API).
You can test the API with swagger file or postman or the actual application.

The solution also has an xUnit project with some Unit and Integration Tests.
